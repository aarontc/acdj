	Program Icon was created in photoshop by Chris, converted to SVG (scalable vector graphic) using Inkscape by Suzy (failed).
	Since the save to svg didn't work, in order to get a usable system tray icon Aaron grabbed one from online.
	Play, pause, stop, next, previous, and all similarly themed buttons created by Suzy using Gimp.
